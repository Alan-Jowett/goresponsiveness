To use install requirements  

Works with python 3.10  
    Should work with more recent  

To set up local venv:  
1. Create a local venv `python -m venv env`
2. Active it (windows) `"./env/Scripts/activate.bat"`
3. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run in script (need to active it or use current) `python graphing.py <dir/log filename>`
  - Where dir is the folder for all the logs
  - Where log filename is any specific log file set to use (will need all 5 outputs in the same directory)
